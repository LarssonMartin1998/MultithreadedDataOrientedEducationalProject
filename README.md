# MultithreadedDataOrientedEducationalProject
I wanted to learn about data oriented design and multi threading, so I wrote a very small program in C++ to practice on just that :)

I can almost guarantee that the "physical calculations" are incorrect, I'm no physisist and didn't focus on getting it right, not important for the purpose of this project either:)
